# Sniffing
This repository is part of my master thesis, which runs on the host machine to enable the transfer of the captured wireless traffic from virtual machine client to windows host over TCP/IP byte stream socket

The wireless traffic sniffer program on linux virtual machine: https://github.com/QiQiQiQiQ/MA_sniffing_client

the host and client programm should run simutaneously

when running the program, an ip address and a port number are required

the ip address is generated by the virtual machine, and can be found in cmd terminal:
~~~
ipconfig
~~~

the port number is determined by user, and the host and client program should use the same one
